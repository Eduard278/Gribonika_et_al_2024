# Notation

Indexes with a trailing 0/1 indicate that the calculation could be performed in two ways:
by incorporating RNA expression (denoted by 0) or by "normalizing" each unique clone by
counting it as 1 instead of using that clone's expression (denoted by 1).

# Basic data point definitions

1. IGH_umis: total number of UMIs that aligned and assembled into a productive receptor sequence (analogous to a receptor RNA count)
2. IGH_ucdr3: total number of unique CDR3s
3. IGH_Shannon: Shannon index from skbio.diversity.alpha
4. IGH_Pielou_evenness: Pielou's evenness index from skbio.diversity.alpha
5. IGH_Simpson: Simpson index from skbio.diversity.alpha
6. IGH_Simpson_evenness: Simpson evenness from skbio.diversity.alpha
7. IGH_Gini_index: Gini index from skbio.diversity.alpha
8. IGH_d50: Percentage of unique CDR3s that make up the top 50% of the total reads. python implementation below

```python
import pandas as pd
def d50(x: pd.Series) -> float:
    """ Percentage of clones that make up the top 50% of the total reads.
    X is an series of counts (reads or UMIs)
    """

    # Important: needs to be sorted first
    x = x.sort_values(ascending=False)
    half = x[x.cumsum() <= x.sum() * 0.50]
    d50 = (len(half) / len(x)) * 100.0
    return d50
```

9. IGH_Largest_clone_percent: percentage reads out ot total reads for the single largest CDR3

10. IgX_percent_by_reads: % expression for that isotype (IgX reads divided by total reads)
11. IgX_percent_by_clone: % of unique CDR3 for that isotype (IgX unique CDR3 divided by total unique CDR3)

12. IgX_SHM0: Mean SHM for all sequences with IgX isotype, weighted by each sequence's expression
13. IgX_SHM1: Mean SHM for all unique sequences with IgX isotype,

where SHM = the number of mutations from CDR2 -> end of V-region, divided by the alignment length

14. IgX_mean_log_ppost0: Mean Log10(ppost) of all clones (CDR3 Peptide + V + J) with IgX isotype, weighted by each clone's expression
15. IgX_mean_log_ppost1: Mean Log10(ppost) of all unique clones (CDR3 Peptide + V + J) with IgX isotype

16. class_switched_percent_by_reads: % expression of all IgA/IgG/IgE sequences
17. naive_mutated_percent_by_reads: % expression of all IgD/M sequences with >0 mutations in V-region
18. naive_unmutated_percent_by_reads: % expression of all IgD/M sequences with 0 mutations in V-region

19. class_switched_percent_by_clone: % of unique sequences with IgA/IgG/IgE isotype
20. naive_mutated_percent_by_clone: % of unique sequences with IgD/M isotype and >0 mutations in V-region
21. naive_unmutated_percent_by_clone: % of unique sequences with IgD/M isotype and 0 mutations in V-region

22. IGHM_IGHD_mutated_by_reads: Of all IgD/M sequences, what percentage of reads are mutated? (have >0 mutations in V-region)
23. IGHM_IGHD_mutated_by_clone: Of all IgD/M sequences, what percentage of unique sequences are mutated? (have >0 mutations in V-region)

24. IgX-IgY CSR0: % of reads present as two isotypes IgX and IgY
25. IgX-IgY CSR1: % of unique CDR3 peptide sequences present as two isotypes IgX and IgY

26. IgX_observed_as_other_isotype: % of unique IgX sequences observed as other isotype
